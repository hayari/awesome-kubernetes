In other words, a collection of software elements that each have their own individual charts but, for whatever reason (e.g. design choices, ease of deployability, versioning complexities), must be installed or upgraded as a since atomic unit.

You might need this as a way to limit the resources use, handle dev/staging environments, or just as a way to contain your tests while working on them. If you have used Helm before, you know that installing applications via Helm charts is simple by using the helm install command. The problem is that after installing a package, you or the user still needs to manually delete the package. With this in mind, we are going to explore how we set Time-To-Live Expiration for helm releases via the Helm release plugin, and create temporary Environments with Time-To-Live to make our lives easier with Helm.
