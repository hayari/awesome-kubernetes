- [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) A tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally inside a Linux VM. It's aimed on users who want to just test it out or use it for development. It cannot spin up a production cluster, it's a one node machine with no high availability.

## Kubernetes Based Development. Kubernetes Development Tools

- [==kubevious== üåüüåü](https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious) Kubevious is a read-only dashboard and config validator. Kubevious gives deep insights on app config and structure.
- [==tilt.dev==](https://tilt.dev) You can use Tilt to easily build and run your application on Kubernetes. In comparison with similar tools, it provides [UI for managing the process and cloud platform](https://cloud.tilt.dev) to share data with your team.
    - [medium: Happy trip to Kubernetes in our company](https://medium.com/condorlabs-engineering/happy-trip-to-kubernetes-in-our-company-85ecfde573fd) Kubernetes Local Development Made Easy! Not Minikube, neither Skaffold, but Tilt to the rescue.
        - Minikube: Initially, they found Minikube as the first solution to manipulate K8s and test everything in our local environment. To manually deploy a service in Minikube they had to build the image in docker every time they made a change. If you are only managing one service this would be easy to handle, but if we work with many services in a repository that needs to be running to work as expected, we should have a way to run those builds automatically and restart the pods to take the new image.
        - Skaffold: They researched how to automatize this and found Skaffold, a tool to create a complete dev environment fully integrated with Kubernetes and Minikube. Skaffold takes over to build all the images that you need, restart the pods and listen for more changes. With this, you can achieve a hot-building feature sending everything to minikube, the devs won‚Äôt have to take care of this task. It was a win for them to find this tool.
        - Challenge: Something that caused friction for the developers was the way they had to run all the code locally. They had to make changes using docker-compose and then, test using Skaffold. This may generate little delays in the development workflow.
        - Tilt to the rescue: Finally, they found Tilt - An open-source tool that is focused on generating a comfortable and customizable rebuild for Docker and Kubernetes. Tilt makes really easy to manage development in a local environment of many services that need to communicate among them. Also, it‚Äôs focused on the Developer Experience. Once they implemented Tilt, they were able to use their services in the dev phase by running: tilt up. With a well-written configuration and settings, you can get reloads in a few milliseconds using the sync feature. Also, it has easy integration with Helm which is the most used package manager for K8s.
