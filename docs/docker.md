- Who is still copying images between registries with:
    - docker cli:
        - docker pull <src>
        - docker tag <src> <dst>
        - docker push <dst>
    - Use:
        - crane cp <src> <dst>
    - Or even:
        - cosign cp <src> <dst>

    - It's faster, and supports multi-arch (and cosign copies signatures/sboms/attestations)

- [stepchowfun/docuum: Docuum: LRU eviction of Docker images üåü](https://github.com/stepchowfun/docuum) Docuum performs least recently used (LRU) eviction of Docker images.
    - Docker's built-in docker image prune --all --filter until=‚Ä¶ command serves a similar purpose. However, the built-in solution isn't ideal since it uses the image creation time, rather than the last usage time, to determine which images to remove. That means it can delete frequently used images, which may be expensive to rebuild.
    - **Docuum is ideal for use cases such as continuous integration (CI) workers, developer workstations, or any other environment in which Docker images accumulate on disk over time.** Docuum works well with tools like Toast and Docker Compose.
    - Docuum is used by Airbnb on its fleet of 1.5k+ CI workers.

When deploying apps to Kubernetes or other container-as-a-service platforms, the proliferation of nonstandard, unauditable containers built manually via Dockerfiles is a real problem. A few products have emerged to solve this problem, among them Cloud Native Buildpacks (–°NB). In this blog post, we explore the capabilities of these buildpacks and explain how to use them in build pipelines to deliver standardized, auditable images as artifacts suitable for deployment.
