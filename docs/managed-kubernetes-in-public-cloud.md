## Introduction

- [infoworld.com: 6 reasons to switch to managed Kubernetes](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3614605/6-reasons-to-switch-to-managed-kubernetes.html) Managed Kubernetes services have matured to the point where many enterprises are handing over the keys to their clusters. Here we identify some of the main drivers behind that trend.
- [Allocatable memory and CPU in Kubernetes Nodes üåü](https://learnk8s.io/allocatable-resources) Not all CPU and memory in your Kubernetes nodes can be used to run Pods. In this article, you will learn how managed Kubernetes Services such AKS, EKS and GKE reserve resources for workloads, operating systems, daemons and Kubernetes agent.
- [==armosec.io: Which Managed Kubernetes Is Right for Me?==](https://www.armosec.io/blog/which-managed-kubernetes-is-right-for-me) This blog will compare on-premises, or self-hosted,Kubernetes clusters to managed ones, as well as outline your options for Kubernetes in the cloud
- [==infoworld.com: CNCF survey: Managed Kubernetes becomes the norm==](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3649710/cncf-survey-managed-kubernetes-becomes-the-norm.html) Cloud Native Computing Foundation‚Äôs latest survey shows that container and Kubernetes usage continues to rise, as managed services ease the operational burden on their teams.

## GKE vs EKS vs AKS

## Other Managed Kubernetes

- [thenewstack.io: Otomi Container Platform Offers an Integrated Kubernetes Bundle](https://thenewstack.io/otomi-container-platform-offers-an-integrated-kubernetes-bundle/) If you want to enjoy the benefits of Kubernetes, configuring and installing the software itself can be just the first of many deeply technical and oftentimes confusing steps. To simplify this, many major cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes services, but even then you may need to install secondary services to handle tasks such as tracing, logging, monitoring, identity access management, and so on. The Otomi Container Platform looks to address this complexity by bundling together more than 30 different Kubernetes add-ons, as well as providing what it calls an ‚ÄúOSX like interface,‚Äù and today the project has open sourced a community edition under the Apache 2.0 license.

    - Autoscaling is an approach to automatically scale up or down workloads based on the resource usage. In Kubernetes, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can scale pods based on observed CPU utilization and memory usage. Starting with Kubernetes 1.7, an aggregation layer was introduced that allows third-party applications to extend the Kubernetes API by registering themselves as API add-ons. Such an add-on can implement the Custom Metrics API and enable HPA access to arbitrary metrics. What follows is a step-by-step guide on configuring HPA with metrics provided by Prometheus to automatically scale pods running on Amazon EKS on AWS Fargate.
