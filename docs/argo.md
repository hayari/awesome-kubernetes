- [blog.argoproj.io: Architecting Workflows For Reliability](https://blog.argoproj.io/architecting-workflows-for-reliability-d33bd720c6cc) Kubernetes is designed for stateless scalable web applications, apps where if one process dies, then another process can be dropped in its place. Kubernetes makes one promise ‚Äî it will kill your pods. Kubernetes expects applications built on it to be tolerant of both any disruption‚Äî so apps must be designed with that in mind.

    ```
    Dear user,
    I will kill your pod:

    If I want the node for something more important.
    If I‚Äôm draining the node, or scaling down a cluster.
    If it runs out of memory (because you got the config wrong).
    If I overcommitted.
    Hardware failure (computer catches fire).
    Kernel panic.
    Absolutely any reason I feel like.

    I‚Äôm sorry ‚Äî I am who I am.

    All the best,

    Kubernetes xx
    ```
