## Introduction

- A Docker registry is a place to store and distribute Docker images.
- It serves as a target for your docker push and docker pull commands.

## OpenShift Registry

- [docs.openshift.com: Integrated OpenShift Container Platform registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/registry/architecture-component-imageregistry.html)
- [cloudowski.com: Openshift ImageStreams](https://cloudowski.com/articles/why-managing-container-images-on-openshift-is-better-than-on-kubernetes/)
- The registry in OCP4 is now managed by an Operator instead of ```oc adm``` registry.

## Quay Registry

- [Quay.io](https://quay.io/) is a hosted Docker registry from CoreOS:
    - Main features:
        - ‚ÄúPowerful build triggers‚Äù 
        - ‚ÄúAdvanced team permissions‚Äù
        - ‚ÄúSecure storage‚Äù
    - One of the more enterprise-friendly options out there, offering fine-grained permission controls.
    - They support any git server and let you build advanced workflows by doing things like mapping git branches to Docker tags so that when you commit code it automatically builds a corresponding image.
    - Quay offers unlimited free public repositories. Otherwise, you pay by the number of private repositories. There‚Äôs no extra charge for storage or bandwidth.
- [Quay 3.0 released in May 2019](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-quay-3-registry-your-linux-and-windows-containers): support for multiple architectures, Windows containers, and a [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)-based image to this container image registry.
- [Quay 3.1 released in September 2019](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-quay-31-now-even-better-across-distributed-environments): The newest Quay feature is repository mirroring, which complements our existing geographic replication features. Repository mirroring reflects content between distinct, different registries. With this, you can synchronize whitelisted repositories or a source registry subset into Quay. This makes it much easier to distribute images and related data through Quay.
