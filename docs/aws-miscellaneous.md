## AWS App Runner

- [AWS App Runner ðŸŒŸ](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) AWS App Runner is one of the simplest ways to run your containerized web applications and APIs on AWS. App Runner abstracts away the cloud resources needed for running your web application or API, including load balancers, TLS certificates, auto-scaling, logs, metrics, tracing (such as observability), as well as the underlying compute resources. With App Runner, you can start with source code or a container image.
- [dev.to: AWS App Runner : How to deploy containerized applications using App Runner](https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-app-runner-how-to-deploy-containerized-applications-using-app-runner-1f7c) AWS App Runner is an AWS service that provides a fast, simple and cost-effective way to deploy from source code or a container image directly to a scalable and secure web application in the AWS Cloud. You donâ€™t need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or know how to provision and configure AWS resources.
