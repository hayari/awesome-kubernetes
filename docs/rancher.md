## Rancher: Enterprise management for Kubernetes

- [rancher.com](https://rancher.com/) Rancher is enterprise management for Kubernetes, an amazing GUI for managing and installing Kubernetes clusters. They have released a number of pieces of software that are part of this ecosystem, for example [Longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn) which is a lightweight and reliable distributed block storage system for Kubernetes.

Rancher is a complete Kubernetes stack that's easy to navigate â€” whether it's physical servers on-prem or in the cloud. This Refcard helps you get started with Rancher â€” from zero to fully production-ready.
- [devclass.com: Rancher presents first big release after SUSE acquisition, ups game on hosted cluster provisioning](https://devclass.com/2021/09/02/rancher-presents-first-big-release-after-suse-acquisition-ups-game-on-hosted-cluster-provisioning/)

- [==blog.kubecost.com: Rancher vs Kubernetes: Itâ€™s not either or==](https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/rancher-vs-kubernetes/) Kubernetes (K8s) and Rancher are both open source projects focused on container management with enormous communities of contributors and users.
    - Kubernetes is the leader in container orchestration. It offers teams the flexibility to efficiently run containerized workloads across multiple public cloud providers and hybrid cloud environments. Kubernetes offers advanced scheduling and scaling capabilities to ensure application performance and high availability. However, its functionality focuses on managing resources within a single cluster.
    - Rancher, on the other hand, is a platform designed to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters. It eases Kubernetes cluster management in large environments in several ways. For example, Rancher simplifies operations such as cluster provisioning, centralized security management, and monitoring workloads using popular tools such as Prometheus. Additionally, Rancher has an extensive application catalog of Helm charts for various applications such as Kubecost, Prometheus, Grafana, and MySQL.

## Rancher 2

- [**Rancher 2**](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/)

### Rancher Networking and CNI Providers

- [Rancher CNI Providers ðŸŒŸ](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/faq/networking/cni-providers/)

### Rancher 2 RKE

- [**Rancher 2 RKE**](https://rancher.com/products/rke/) Rancher 2 that runs in docker containers. RKE is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It solves the common frustration of installation complexity with Kubernetes by removing most host dependencies and presenting a stable path for deployment, upgrades, and rollbacks.
    - [Rancher.com: Setup a basic Kubernetes cluster with ease using RKE](https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-09-26-setup-basic-kubernetes-cluster-with-ease-using-rke/)

## K3S

- [**k3s**](https://k3s.io/) Basic kubernetes with automated installer. Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution.
- [K8s vs k3s](https://www.civo.com/blog/k8s-vs-k3s) "K3s is designed to be a single binary of less than 40MB that completely implements the Kubernetes API. In order to achieve this, they removed a lot of extra drivers that didn't need to be part of the core and are easily replaced with add-ons. K3s is a fully CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) [certified Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) offering. This means that you can write your YAML to operate against a regular "full-fat" Kubernetes and they'll also apply against a k3s cluster. Due to its low resource requirements, it's possible to run a cluster on anything from 512MB of RAM machines upwards. This means that we can allow pods to run on the master, as well as nodes. And of course, because it's a tiny binary, it means we can install it in a fraction of the time it takes to launch a regular Kubernetes cluster! We generally achieve sub-two minutes to launch a k3s cluster with a handful of nodes, meaning you can be deploying apps to learn/test at the drop of a hat."
- [**k3sup (said 'ketchup')**](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) is a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM. All you need is ssh access and the k3sup binary to get kubectl access immediately.

### K3OS

- [**k3OS**](https://github.com/rancher/k3os) k3OS is a Linux distribution designed to remove as much OS maintenance as possible in a Kubernetes cluster. It is specifically designed to only have what is needed to run k3s. Additionally the OS is designed to be managed by kubectl once a cluster is bootstrapped. Nodes only need to join a cluster and then all aspects of the OS can be managed from Kubernetes. Both k3OS and k3s upgrades are handled by the k3OS operator.
- [**K3OS Value Add**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LNxGVS81mE):
    - **Supports multiple architectures**
        - K3OS runs on x86 and ARM processors to give you maximum flexibility.
    - **Runs only the minimum required services**
        - Fewer services means a tiny attack surface, for greater security.
    - **Doesn't require a package manager**
        - The required services are built into the distribution image.
    - **Models infrastructure as code**
        - Manage system configuration with version control systems.

## K3C

- [K3C](https://github.com/rancher/k3c) Lightweight local container engine for container development. K3C is a local container engine designed to fill the same gap Docker does in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Specifically k3c focuses on developing and running local containers, basically docker run/build. Currently k3s, the [lightweight Kubernetes distribution](https://github.com/rancher/k3s), provides a great solution for Kubernetes from dev to production. While k3s satisifies the Kubernetes runtime needs, one still needs to run docker (or a docker-like tool) to actually develop and build the container images. k3c is intended to replace docker for just the functionality needed for the Kubernetes ecosystem.
