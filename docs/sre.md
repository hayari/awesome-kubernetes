- [Google: What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?](https://landing.google.com/sre/) SRE is what you get when you treat operations as if it‚Äôs a software problem. Our mission is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of Google‚Äôs public services ‚Äî Google Search, Ads, Gmail, Android, YouTube, and App Engine, to name just a few ‚Äî with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity.

- [youtube: Platform9‚Äôs Madhura Maskasky says observability is also essential for diagnosing and debugging in order for SREs to "get to the root cause quickly enough so that you can feed that back to the development teams." üåü](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgRPlAQpHYk&ab_channel=TheNewStack) Debugging remains complex. Debugging in "a world of microservices is a very difficult task," requiring the identification of which specific part in a microservices deployment must be fixed, says Platform9‚Äôs Madhura Maskasky.
    - "What's happening to the system administrator or is the system administrator becoming an SRE? Are they going into different roles? Are they taking multiple roles? How do they play a part in ensuring that reliability in these new roles?"
    - "The way Google defines SRE is that an SRE by nature needs to be someone who develops or writes code 50% of the time and only remaining 50% of the time they do the traditional ops/operations and this is because they want to do more through automation as part of the role of the requirements of the SRE himself, so that you can run apps that can serve billions of requests but that are still handled by a few dozens of SREs."
    - "Suddenly the role for SRE gets democratized and distributed among different roles (developers included)".

    | **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) team**| **Developers**	| **Operations team** |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | Provide and teach effective use of platform tooling to empower developers to be self-sufficient | Treat SREs as application operation partners, not only as first responders to incidents | Provide self-service platform deployment and observability, and enable visibility into ramifications of actions |
    |Document clear escalation paths for developers struggling in production | Turn to ops teams for the ‚Äúpaved path‚Äù or centralized developer control plane | Provide opinionated ‚Äúpaved path‚Äù platform or developer control plane (DCP), but allow developers to swap platform components if they also want to be accountable |

### OpenSLO

- [OpenSLO specification üåü](https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO) The goal of this project is to provide an open specification for defining and interfacing with SLOs to allow for a common approach, giving a set vendor-agnostic solution to defining and tracking SLOs. Platform specific implementation details are purposefully excluded from the scope of this specification.
