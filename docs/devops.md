## Introduction to Digital Business Transformation

- [What Is AIOps, BizDevOps, CloudOps, DevOps, ITOps, NoOps? A Gentle Introduction to Digital Business Transformation 🌟](https://stxnext.com/blog/2019/04/25/aiops-bizdevops-cloudops-devops-itops-noops-introduction-digital-business-transformation/)
- [enterprisersproject.com: DevOps: 5 things teams need from CIOs](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/7/devops-5-things-teams-need) Consider these lessons learned as you strive to give DevOps teams what they need to succeed - from flexible technogy models to transparency.
- [redhat.com: Understanding DevOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops) DevOps is an approach to culture, automation, and platform design intended to deliver increased business value and responsiveness through rapid, high-quality service delivery. This is all made possible through fast-paced, iterative IT service delivery. DevOps means linking legacy apps with newer cloud-native apps and infrastructure.
- [redhat.com: El concepto de DevOps](https://www.redhat.com/es/topics/devops) DevOps es un modo de abordar la cultura, la automatización y el diseño de las plataformas para generar mayor valor empresarial y capacidad de respuesta, mediante la prestación ágil de servicios de alta calidad. Todo ello es posible gracias a la prestación rápida y constante de servicios de TI. Para DevOps, se necesita vincular las aplicaciones heredadas con las aplicaciones creadas en la nube y las infraestructuras más nuevas.

- [==dzone.com/trendreports/devops-3: DevOps==](https://dzone.com/trendreports/devops-3) CI/CD and Application Release Orchestration. With the need for companies to deliver capabilities faster, it has become increasingly clear that DevOps is a practice that many enterprises must adopt (if they haven’t already). A strong CI/CD pipeline leads to a smoother release process, and a smoother release process decreases time to market. In DZone’s "DevOps: CI/CD and Application Release Orchestration" Trend Report, we provide insight into how CI/CD has revolutionized automated testing, offer advice on why an SRE is important to CI/CD, explore the differences between managed and self-hosted CI/CD, and much more. The goal of this Trend Report is to offer guidance to our global audience of DevOps Engineers, Automation Architects, and all those in between on how to best adopt DevOps practices to help scale the productivity of their teams.

## Automation anxiety

{==

- Sysadmins and engineers may have personal fears about adopting automation, as much of their typical day revolves around the manual tasks and processes that automation promises to eliminate. Automation anxiety is the fear that if these tasks can be handled by automated tools, there will no longer be any reason to keep a person in that role. Nobody likes being automated out of a job.
- Automation anxiety is largely unfounded, however, as automating manual tasks frees up people’s time that can instead be used to work on more innovative, more strategic and higher value projects.

## Configuration Drift

- [Dzone: Configuration Drift 🌟](https://dzone.com/articles/configuration-drift) Configuration Drift is the phenomenon where running servers in an infrastructure become more and more different as time goes on, due to manual ad-hoc changes and updates, and general entropy.
- [What is Configuration Drift?](https://www.continuitysoftware.com/blog/it-resilience/what-is-configuration-drift/) Configuration drift  is a data center environment term. At a high level, configuration drift happens when production or primary hardware and software infrastructure configurations “drift” or become different in some way from a recovery or secondary configuration or visa versa.  Production or primary and recovery or secondary configurations are designed to be identical in certain aspects is order for business resumption should there be a disaster or major failure in production.  When these infrastructure configurations drift from another, they leave a gap between them which commonly called a configuration gap.

### Drift Detection Tools

- [env0.com: Automated Drift Detection 🌟](https://www.env0.com/blog/automated-drift-detection-with-env0) env0 is enabling the ability to automatically detect drift and make sure your real-world resources in the cloud provider are aligned with your Infrastructure as Code files. env0 will alert you once a drift has been detected and gives you the ability to view and fix the drift, which can help mitigate one of the main challenges when using Infrastructure as Code!

    - Its a culture, concept, process and approach that merges software requirement gathering, software development, testing, quality assurance, system configurations, product deployment and operations. Organizations building or improving software products are moving towards a DevOps approach where development, testing, security, quality assurance and operations are getting merged within a large team and those technical resources work side by side to achieve higher return on investment
    - DevOps is one of the most broad topics within software dev because it lacks boundaries and limitations. Many technologies, tools, concepts, processes and ideas converge to give a good DevOps pipeline and DevOps process resulting in agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and high level monitoring of your enterprise level software systems. Hence, devops is not a single role or even a team's work that deals with all the technologies and processes. It a mixture of culture, traditions and process.

So, for now, let’s list some typical activities you might have in this role:
    - Providing leadership and guidance for reducing the time it takes to deploy a software change.
    - Managing CI (continuous integration) systems and pipelines.
    - Creating automated software builds and testing.
    - Designing and implementing infrastructure.
    - Automating infrastructure buildout and maintenance.
    - Managing and enhancing logging and monitoring systems.
    - Providing developers with self-service tools for provisioning systems, deploying code, and running tests.
