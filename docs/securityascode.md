The policies are written in Rego, a high-level declarative language, its purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures. For detailed information on Rego see the Policy Language documentation.

## Kyverno

- [Kyverno ðŸŒŸ](https://kyverno.io/) Kubernetes Native Policy Management. Open Policy Agent? Thatâ€™s old school. Securely manage workloads on your kubernetesio clusters with this handy new tool, Kyverno.Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

As a best practice, older API versions should be replaced with newer versions. This policy validates for APIs that are deprecated or scheduled for removal. Note that checking for some of these resources may require modifying the Kyverno ConfigMap to remove filters.
