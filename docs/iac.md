### Config Connector

- [==cloud.google.com/config-connector==](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview) Config Connector is an open source Kubernetes addon that allows you to manage Google Cloud resources through Kubernetes.
- [medium.com/globant: Infrastructure as Code using Kubernetes](https://medium.com/globant/infrastructure-as-code-using-kubernetes-d3d329446517)
    - Config Connector (KCC) is a solution to maintain Cloud Resources as Infrastructure as Code. It is built as an Open Source initiative and runs on Kubernetes clusters. As such, it leverages YAML files to maintain and operate such resources.
    - Config Connector has two versions: an Add-On for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters and a manual installation for other Kubernetes distributions.
