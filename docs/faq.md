## Migration Styles. Lift and Shift Cloud Migration Strategy

- [From monolith to containers: How Verizon containerized legacy applications on OpenShift üåü](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6i0LK4vHsU):
    - Lift and shift is a cloud migration strategy that refers to removing workloads and tasks from one storage location and placing them in another, usually cloud-based, location.
    - Moving applications to the cloud can be challenging if you are unprepared. In fact, many businesses experience some level of migration failure because of poor planning.
    - The lift and shift migration style is one of the approaches that can help you transition to the cloud without the need to redesign applications or disrupt workflow operations.
    - It all starts with containerizing the applications using platforms like Docker and then moving entirely to a microservices architecture.

- [dzone: The Best Cloud Migration Approach: Lift-And-Shift, Replatform, Or Refactor?](https://dzone.com/articles/the-best-cloud-migration-approach-lift-and-shift-r) There are a number of ways to get your applications to the cloud, but the question of which method to use is a little up in the air.
- [dzone: 10 Commandments of Microservice Decomposition üåü](https://dzone.com/articles/10-commandments-on-microservice-decomposition) In this article, I will try to cover the purposes of terms used while decomposing microservices and try to fit them under one umbrella concept.
