	2. __Versioned and Immutable:__ Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history. ‚ÄúThe only way for you to introduce change in your system is by creating a new version of your desired state,‚Äô Murillo added.
	3. __Pulled Automatically:__ Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source. Agents within the system pull the desired state from the repository.
	4. __Continuously Reconciled:__ Software agents continuously observe the actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state. ‚ÄúThe desired state [of the system or software] is continually reconciled, Murillo said.

## GitOps Working Group

- [GitOps Working Group üåü](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group)
- The Five GitOps Principles (as defined by the GitOps Working Group) to the lifecycle of an infrastructure resource, like a virtual machine or load balancer:
    - Declarative Configuration (define the resource as code)
    - Version controlled (use source control to manage the resource definition)
    - Automated delivery (provision and manage the resource from the definition using automation)
    - Software Agents (implement automated configuration management for the resource)
    - Closed loop (build the delivery pipeline for integration testing for resource changes)

## OpenGitOps Project

- [github.com/open-gitops/project üåü](https://github.com/open-gitops/project) OpenGitOps is a CNCF Sandbox project to define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps. This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification through lasting programs, documents, and code.

## GitOps Patterns

- [==github.com/cloudogu/gitops-patterns==](https://github.com/cloudogu/gitops-patterns) Collection of patterns, examples and resources for GitOps process design, GitOps repository structures, etc.
- [github.com/cloudogu/gitops-playground#example-applications](https://github.com/cloudogu/gitops-playground#example-applications) Creates a complete GitOps-based operational stack on your Kubernetes clusters

## Git Repositories Structures

- [==dzone: GitOps: How to Ops Your Git the Right Way== üåü](https://dzone.com/articles/gitops-how-to-ops-your-git-the-right-way) In this article we‚Äôll look into the specifics of creating Git repositories structures ‚Ää‚Äî ‚Ääthe very core of the GitOps approach.
- [==codefresh.io: Stop Using Branches for Deploying to Different GitOps Environments==](https://codefresh.io/about-gitops/branches-gitops-environments/) How do I promote a release to the next environment? __You should NOT use Git branches for modeling different environments. If the Git repository holding your configuration (manifests/templates in the case of Kubernetes) has branches named ‚Äústaging‚Äù, ‚ÄúQA‚Äù, ‚ÄúProduction‚Äù and so on, then you have fallen into a trap.__ Using branches for different environments should only be applied to legacy applications.

    - Separate your repositories
    - Separate development in directories, not branches

GitOps users seek ideal Kubernetes config tool üåü](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252492459/GitOps-pros-grapple-with-Kubernetes-configuration-management) Configuration management challenges GitOps early adopters, especially at large enterprises with millions of lines of Kubernetes YAML to manage. Ultimately, the industry hasn't found an ideal approach to Kubernetes configuration management, especially for GitOps.

- [==vimeo.com: Weaveworks - Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Strategies for Kubernetes with GitOps==](https://vimeo.com/516520492) One of the biggest advantages Kubernetes has to offer is that it is agnostic to infrastructure and capable of managing diverse workloads running on different compute resources. This allows organizations to manage multiple developer platforms, who can operate across many environments such as on premise, hybrid and multiple clouds.
    - Streamlined processes and automation is pivotal for operations when managing clusters at scale and maintaining security and policy checks. Paul Curtis, Principal Solutions Architect will demonstrate GitOps and Weave Kubernetes Platform in a hybrid and multi-cloud setup.
    - Learn how to:
        - Use model-driven automation to increases reliability and stability across environments
        - Simplify multi-cluster management with GitOps
        - Enable developers to push code to production daily (self-service)
        - Improve utilization and capacity management through Kubernetes platforms on cloud and on-premise infrastructure
