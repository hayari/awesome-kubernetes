- [Dzone: Understanding OpenShift Security Context Constraints](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-openshift-security-context-constrain)

#### Review Security Context Constraints

- Security Context Constraints (SCCs) control what actions pods can perform and what resources they can access. 
- SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts.
- OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the restricted SCC, and the least constrained in the privileged SCC. 
The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default.
- The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs. Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible.
- Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC.
- **Recommendations:** 
    - Use OpenShift's Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/). PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12.
    - Use the restricted SCC as the default 
    - For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Audit
    - To show all available SCCs: `oc describe scc`
    - To audit a single pod: `oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\/scc`
    - Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required

#### Network Security Zones

- [OpenShift and Network Security Zones: Coexistence Approaches üåüüåüüåü](https://www.openshift.com/blog/openshift-and-network-security-zones-coexistence-approaches)
    - **Introduction:** Kubernetes and consequently OpenShift adopt a [flat Software Defined Network (SDN) model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/), which means that all pods in the SDN are in the same logical network. Traditional network implementations adopt a zoning model in which different networks or zones are dedicated to specific purposes, with very strict communication rules between each zone. When implementing OpenShift in organizations that are using network security zones, the two models may clash. In this article, we will analyze a few options for coexistence. But first, let‚Äôs understand the two network models a bit more in depth.
    - Network Zones have been the widely accepted approach for building security into a network architecture. The general idea is to create separate networks, each with a specific purpose. Each network contains devices with similar security profiles. Communications between networks is highly scrutinized and controlled by firewall rules ([perimeter defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_round_defence)).
    - **Conclusion:** A company‚Äôs security organization must be involved when deciding how to deploy OpenShift with regard to traditional network zones. Depending on their level of comfort with new technologies you may have different options. If physical network separation is the only acceptable choice, you will have to build a cluster per network zone. If logical network type of separations can be considered, then there are ways to stretch a single OpenShift deployment across multiple network zones. This post presented a few technical approaches.

## IBM Cloud Paks and OpenShift

- [cloudpak8s.io](https://cloudpak8s.io/) 
- **What are IBM Cloud Paks?** Beyond containers and Kubernetes, enterprises need to orchestrate their production topology, and to provide management, security and governance for their applications. They need to do this while improving efficiency and resiliency, reducing costs and maximizing ROI.
- IBM Cloud¬Æ Paks are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions that give clients an open, faster and more secure way to move core business applications to any cloud. Each IBM Cloud Pak¬Æ includes containerized IBM middleware and common software services for development and management, on top of a common integration layer ‚Äî designed to **reduce development time by up to 84 percent and operational expenses by up to 75 percent**. **IBM Cloud Paks run wherever Red Hat¬Æ OpenShift¬Æ runs** and are optimized for productivity and performance on [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift).
- [IBM Cloud Pak Playbook](https://cloudpak8s.io/apps/cp4a_overview/) The **Cloud Pak for Applications** provides product offerings to support **modernizing existing applications and building new cloud native applications**. The applications run within a **Kubernetes cluster** provided with the **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform**. The focus provided here is on running application workloads as containers. The Cloud Pak for Applications is a bundle of multiple offerings.  This diagram provides an overview of what offerings are included and what they would be used for:
