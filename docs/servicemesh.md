Leaving the microservices to address these requirements leads to an expensive and time consuming development process. In this blog, weâ€™ll provide an overview of the most common microservice communication requirements that the Service Mesh architecture pattern solves.

    - Service Mesh is an emerging architecture pattern gaining traction today. Along with Kubernetes, Service Mesh can form a powerful platform which addresses the technical requirements that arise in a highly distributed environment typically found on a microservices cluster and/or service infrastructure. A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between microservices.
    - Service Mesh addresses the communication requirements typical in a microservices-based application, including encrypted tunnels, health checks, circuit breakers, load balancing and traffic permission. Leaving the microservices to address these requirements leads to an expensive and time consuming development process.
    - Kong provides an enterprise-class and comprehensive service connectivity platform that includes an API gateway, a Kubernetes ingress controller and a Service Mesh implementation. The platform allows customers to deploy on multiple environments such as on premises, hybrid, multi-Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­region and multi-cloud.
