## Introduction

- [kustomize.io ðŸŒŸ](https://kustomize.io/)
    - Kustomize introduces a template-free way to customize application configuration that simplifies the use of off-the-shelf applications. Now, built into ```kubectl``` as ```apply -k```.
    - Kustomize traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add, remove or update configuration options without forking.
    - __It is available both as a standalone binary and as a native feature of kubectl.__
- [kubernetes.io: Introducing kustomize; Template-free Configuration Customization for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/05/29/introducing-kustomize-template-free-configuration-customization-for-kubernetes/) If you run a Kubernetes environment, chances are youâ€™ve customized a Kubernetes configuration â€” you've copied some API object YAML files and edited them to suit your needs. But there are drawbacks to this approach â€” it can be hard to go back to the source material and incorporate any improvements that were made to it. Today Google is announcing kustomize, a command-line tool contributed as a subproject of SIG-CLI. The tool provides a new, purely declarative approach to configuration customization that adheres to and leverages the familiar and carefully designed Kubernetes API.

Although those two tools have similar features, they are fundamentally different. In this post, Iâ€™ll compare them from several points of view with a sample application.
