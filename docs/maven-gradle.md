```bash
mvn dependency:analyze  (shows you the usage of listed and unlisted dependencies)
mvn dependency:resolve  (give me a list of everything I have declared, a nice way to avoid reading the POM file)
mvn dependency:tree     (how you got something on your classpath)

## SDKMAN

- [SdkMan](https://sdkman.io/) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Formerly known as **GVM** the **Groovy enVironment Manager**, it was inspired by the very useful [RVM](https://rvm.io/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) tools, used at large by the Ruby community.

- **Demo:** A single Jenkinsfile, a Java Maven project, a single Dockerfile, multiple Java versions build and tested in parallel thanks to SDKMAN:

    - [Multiple Java versions in a single Jenkins Pipeline using Docker and SDKMANðŸŒŸ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1lH3vOhucw) In this video, I show you how you can use Jenkins Declarative Pipeline to create a build pipeline that compiles the Maven Java project using three different Java versions (8, 11, and 15.) You will learn how to use a matrix section of the Jenkins Pipeline to define parallel stages, as well as how to create a Docker image that provides both Java and Maven using the powerful SDKMAN command-line tool. After watching this video you should feel comfortable with setting up multiple parallel stages to build your Java project using different versions of the compiler. And what is most important - it does not require creating Dockerfiles for each Java version. I will show you how to build the pipeline using just a single Dockerfile that does the job.
