### Jenkins Container Images in OpenShift

- [docs.okd.io: Jenkins in Openshift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/using_images/other_images/jenkins.html) Openshift provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

## ODO - OpenShift Command line for Developers

- [ODO: OpenShift Command line for Developers ðŸŒŸ](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo) OpenShift Do (Odo) is a CLI tool for developers who are writing, building, and deploying applications on OpenShift. With Odo, developers get an opinionated CLI tool that supports fast, iterative development which abstracts away Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts, thus allowing them to focus on what's most important to them: code.

### Fabric8 Pipeline Library (deprecated)

- [Fabric8](https://fabric8.io/) has been available as a Java client for Kubernetes since 2015, and today is one of the most popular client libraries for Kubernetes (the most popular is [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go), which is the client library for the Go programming language on Kubernetes). In recent years, **fabric8 has evolved from a Java client for the Kubernetes REST API to a full-fledged alternative to the kubectl command-line tool for Java-based development**.

### Eclipse JKube Pipeline Library (formerly known as Fabric8 Kubernetes Plugin). Kubernetes & OpenShift Plugins

- [Eclipse JKube ðŸŒŸ](https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/) Cloud-Native Java Applications without a hassle. Eclipse JKube is a collection of Maven and Gradle plugins, and libraries that are used for building container images using Docker, JIB or S2I build strategies. Eclipse JKube generates and deploys Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests at compile time too. It brings your Java applications on to Kubernetes and OpenShift by leveraging the tasks required to make your application cloud-native. Eclipse JKube also provides a set of tools such as watch, debug, log, etc. to improve your developer experience.

### OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline (DSL) Plugin. Scripted Syntax (Groovy DSL syntax) VS Declarative Syntax

- [Building Declarative Pipelines with OpenShift DSL Plugin ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ](https://www.openshift.com/blog/building-declarative-pipelines-openshift-dsl-plugin):
    - [Jenkins Pipeline Syntax: Scripted Syntax (Groovy DSL syntax) & Declarative Syntax ðŸŒŸ](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/): 
        - **Version 2.5 of the "Pipeline plugin" released in 2016/05/16 introduces support for Declarative Pipeline syntax**.
        - Declarative Pipeline is a relatively recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems. 
    - **Jenkinsfiles have only become an integral part of Jenkins since version 2** but they have quickly become the de-facto standard for building continuous delivery pipelines with Jenkins. **Jenkinsfile allows defining pipelines as code using a Groovy DSL syntax** and checking it into source version control which allows you to track, review, audit, and manage the lifecycle of changes to the continuous delivery pipelines the same way that you manage the source code of your application. 
    - Although the **Groovy DSL syntax which is referred to as the scripted syntax** is the more well-known and established syntax for building Jenkins pipelines and **was the default when Jenkins 2 was released**, support for a **newer declarative syntax is also added since Jenkins 2.5** in order to offer a simplified way for controlling all aspects of the pipeline. Although the scripted and declarative syntax provides two ways to define your pipeline, they both translate to the same execution blocks in Jenkins and achieve the same result. 
    - The declarative syntax in its simplest form is composed of an agent which defines the Jenkins slave to be used for executing the pipeline and a number of stages and each stage with a number of steps to be performed.
