    - When people focusing more on the security of containers, distroless based images are frequently used to reduce the attack surface. In these images, the package manager, the non-dependent modules or libraries, even the shells are stripped off, only the app and its required dependencies are kept. For the statically linked executable, produced by golang for example, we can even use ‚Äúscratch‚Äù as the base.
    - The potential exploit of vulnerability is therefore greatly reduced. But, on the other hand, it is difficult to troubleshoot the application if even the shell is not available, leaving only the logs from the app.
    - In this paper, we will explore different options to facilitate debugging by bringing back the shell.

Many people think about starting an application in the cloud but rarely pay attention to how it ends. Once, we caught quite a few errors explicitly related to pods stopping. For example, we saw that Kubernetes occasionally kills our application before it releases resources, although it seems that this should not happen. It was impossible to reproduce the problem immediately, and we wondered what was happening under the hood?

This feature is primarily aimed at forensic analysis, but general backup-and-restore is something any Kubernetes user can take advantage of. So, let's take a look at this brand-new feature and see how we can enable it in our clusters and leverage it for backup-and-restore or forensic analysis.

    - An ‚ÄúInvisible‚Äù OOM Kill occurs when a child process in a container ( any process which is not the main process, PID 1 ) gets OOM Killed. In that scenario, the OOM Kill that occurred is ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to Kubernetes, and as users we wouldn‚Äôt be aware of it.
    - The Solution: The entire scenario changes with Kubernetes version 1.28. Starting from that version, Kubernetes enables, by default, a cgroup v2 feature known as ‚Äúcgroup grouping.‚Äù

- [==opensource.googleblog.com: Introducing Ephemeral Containers==](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/01/Introducing%20Ephemeral%20Containers.html) **Ephemeral containers are a new type of container that are part of the Kubernetes core API. An Ephemeral Container may be added to an existing Pod for administrative actions like debugging, it runs until it exits, and it won't be restarted. An ephemeral container runs within the Pod's existing resource allocation and shares common container namespaces.**
- [linkedin.com: Kubernetes Ephemeral Containers | Bibin Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kubernetes-ephemeral-containers-bibin-wilson/) Ephemeral Containers is one of the k8s beta features. The following command will add the debug-image container to the running frontend pod and take an exec session for debugging: ```kubectl debug -it pods/frontend --image=debug-image```

- [medium.com/@blgreco72: Debugging Kubernetes Services Locally üåü](https://medium.com/@blgreco72/debugging-kubernetes-services-locally-8cb14bf8745a) There are various approaches for debugging Microservices hosted within Kubernetes. The approach used here does not alter the Kubernetes cluster in anyway to support developing Microservices, running external to the cluster, within the developer‚Äôs IDE. This is accomplished by mapping ports on the developer‚Äôs workstation to services that are normally only accessible from containers running within the cluster.

- [medium.com/@alex.ivenin: Exploring ephemeral containers in kubernetes üåü](https://medium.com/@alex.ivenin/exploring-ephemeral-containers-in-kubernetes-bcceaf21101c) Ephemeral containers, a feature that was introduced in Kubernetes 1.16 as an alpha release, advanced to beta status in version 1.23, and has finally graduated to stable status in Kubernetes 1.25. This capability provides an easy and safe way to debug running containers in a pod, without requiring full access to the underlying node.

## Troubleshooting Tools

- [github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot) Troubleshoot is a framework for collecting and analyzing diagnostic information about a Kubernetes cluster. The framework is customizable and allows third-party application developers to create troubleshoot specs that can be run by cluster operators.
- [github.com/airwallex: k8s-pod-restart-info-collector](https://github.com/airwallex/k8s-pod-restart-info-collector) k8s-pod-restart-info-collector is a simple Kubernetes customer controller that watches for Pods changes and collects K8s Pod restart reasons, logs, and events to Slack channels when a Pod restarts

### Komodor

- [==komodor.com==](https://komodor.com) Turn troubleshooting chaos into clarity. Komodor is an observability tool that gives you insight into what‚Äôs happening with your clusters and workloads. It integrates tools that we all use, like Datadog, Okta, LaunchDarkly, and PagerDuty.

### cdebug and debug-ctr

- [==iximiuz/cdebug==](https://github.com/iximiuz/cdebug) a swiss army knife of container debugging. It's like "docker exec", but it works even for containers without a shell (scratch, distroless, slim, etc). The "cdebug exec" command allows you to bring your own toolkit and start a shell inside of a running container.
- [==felipecruz91/debug-ctr==](https://github.com/felipecruz91/debug-ctr) A commandline tool for interactive troubleshooting when a container has crashed or a container image doesn't include debugging utilities, such as distroless images. Heavily inspired by kubectl debug, but for containers instead of Pods.

### kubectl-debug

- [github.com/JamesTGrant/kubectl-debug](https://github.com/JamesTGrant/kubectl-debug) kubectl-debug is a tool that lets you debug a target container in a Kubernetes cluster by automatically creating a new, non-invasive, 'debug' container in the same PID, network, user, and IPC namespace as the target container without any disruption
