Traditionally, developers have used resource adapters for message bridging with external systems. A resource adapter is a system library that provides connectivity to an enterprise information system (EIS). Similar to how a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver provides connectivity to a database management system, a resource adapter plugs into an application server such as Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP). It then connects the application server, enterprise information system, and the enterprise application.

### From Jenkins Freestyle jobs to Pipeline, with JobDSL. Seed jobs

- [Meetup event: From Freestyle jobs to Pipeline, with JobDSL](https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/events/270600737/)
    - Manually managing Jenkins jobs is painful. Jenkins Pipeline exists, but how do you get started and why should you bother in the first place? Journey with Nicolaj, as he talks about the pains of managing a manually configured job in Jenkins; converts a Freestyle Job to JobDSL, instantly; introduces mechanisms for adding the jobs to Jenkins, as code; and ultimately converts the job to a Jenkins Pipeline!
    - Just like last time, in the talk “Configuration as Code of Jenkins (for Kubernetes),” you’ll see plenty of live demos and get to take home all the code and examples afterwards. Use it as the starting point for taking advantage of the Configuration as Code (CasC) that everyone is talking about, and hopefully it will save you a lot of headache in the future!
    - Agenda:
        - Manual Freestyle jobs, and why they hurt us
        - Introduction to JobDSL and adding JobDSL-jobs to Jenkins
        - From Freestyle Jobs to JobDSL, the beginning of our CasC adventure
        - From JobDSL to Pipeline, all the fun of CasC; with even more resilience!
    - Nicolaj Græsholt is a Continuous Delivery and DevOps Consultant and Trainer from Eficode Praqma. He helps organizations with all things CI/CD, Artifact Management, Git, Docker and Kubernetes, and he’s a Certified Kubernetes Administrator of CNCF.

### SDKMAN

- [SdkMan](https://sdkman.io/) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Formerly known as **GVM** the **Groovy enVironment Manager**, it was inspired by the very useful [RVM](https://rvm.io/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) tools, used at large by the Ruby community.

    - [Multiple Java versions in a single Jenkins Pipeline using Docker and SDKMAN 🌟](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1lH3vOhucw) In this video, I show you how you can use Jenkins Declarative Pipeline to create a build pipeline that compiles the Maven Java project using three different Java versions (8, 11, and 15.) You will learn how to use a matrix section of the Jenkins Pipeline to define parallel stages, as well as how to create a Docker image that provides both Java and Maven using the powerful SDKMAN command-line tool. After watching this video you should feel comfortable with setting up multiple parallel stages to build your Java project using different versions of the compiler. And what is most important - it does not require creating Dockerfiles for each Java version. I will show you how to build the pipeline using just a single Dockerfile that does the job.

### Jenkins Scripts

- **cleanup.Jenkinsfile**: Jenkinsfile with Declarative Pipeline Multiline sh that cleanups old builds. All the Stages are now visually monitored. It is triggered every saturday night and ends with jenkins restart. These Multi-line bash commands make easier to read Jenkins Projects.
- **daily_restart.Jenkinsfile**: A script that automatically triggers a daily restart of Jenkins due to performance issues (Jenkins is a Java application). Jenkins with Declarative Pipeline multiline sh that restarts Jenkins every night except on Saturday nights (when cleanup.Jenkinsfile is triggered).
- **confluence6-docker-build.Jenkinsfile**: Declarative Jenkinsfile for building and uploading a docker image to Openshift-DEV, Dockerhub and Openshift-PROD (Stages are disabled via Conditional Build Steps). Tip: A Docker Plugin for Jenkins can easily replace this Jenkinsfile.
